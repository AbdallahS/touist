TouIST Project
==============
TouIST is a user-friendly tool for solving propositionnal logic problems using a high-level logic language (known as the _bigand_ format or syntax or language). This language allows complex expressions like _big and_, _sets_... 

We can for example solve the problem "Wolf, Sheep, Cabbage", or a sudoku, or any problem that can be expressed in propositionnal logic.

The TouIST has been initialized by Frederic Maris and Olivier Gasquet, associate professors at the _Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse_ (IRIT). It is a "second" or "new" version of a previous program, [SAToulouse](http://www.irit.fr/satoulouse/).

The development is done by a team of five students in first year of master's degree at the _Université Toulouse III — Paul Sabatier_. This project is a part of their work at school.

## What TouIST looks like

SAToulouse had several drawbacks and had to be re-written. But here is what it looks like:
